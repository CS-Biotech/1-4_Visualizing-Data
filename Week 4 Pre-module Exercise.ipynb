    "# Week 4: Visualizing Data ðŸ“Š\n",
    "## Pre-module\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful skills in data science is visualization. Data scientists and researchers rely not only on numbers, but plots and diagrams to guide their analysis. Visualization also helps us demonstrate our findings to a wider audience, which is one of our primary goals; if the results cannot be understood by others easily, all our work would be for naught. This week's modules will focus on tools for visualizing data.\n",

    "1. How to generate histograms using ```hist()```\n",

    "We learned some valuable information from descriptive statistics in the previous week, but it is difficult to get a sense of the distribution of data just by looking at the percentiles generated by by the DataFrame function ```describe()```. We can leverage visualization functions to generate histograms of the data so we can better understand the distribution in one snapshot.\n",

It has many optional parameters that allow you to specify the number of buckets, the columns you want (if not all), the size and labels of the plots, and more.\n",
