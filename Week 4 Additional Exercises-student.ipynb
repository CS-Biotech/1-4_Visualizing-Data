By the conclusion of these exercises, our objective is to produce plots that are not just tools for data organization, but also of a quality suitable for publication.\n",

Enhancements such as increasing the font sizes, incorporating images, and altering the color scheme have collectively transformed the diagram, making it significantly easier to understand and analyze."
